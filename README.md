# ML-model, gap-acceptance-behaviour
This study proposes a deep neural network architecture for the Gap acceptance model of self-driving
vehicles at unsignalized intersections. Gap acceptance behavior plays a key role in merging minor road
vehicles into the major lane and it is a process that occurs in different traffic situations, such as crossing a
road, entering a roundabout, or performing an overtaking maneuver on a bi-directional road. The decision
to enter the main lane largely depends on the speed, distance, and heaviness of the potentially conflicting
vehicle on the major road. In this paper, the neural network has been built to predict the gap acceptance
behavior. The type of major road vehicle and minor road vehicle, speed, and distance of the major lane
vehicle in the main lane are the input parameters considered to the ANNâ€™S. This paper analyses the
accepted and rejected gaps data collected from a particular Intersection. The results of this analysis can
have important implications for road safety.
